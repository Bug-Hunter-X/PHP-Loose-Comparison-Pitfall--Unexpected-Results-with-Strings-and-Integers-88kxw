This code snippet demonstrates a potential issue with PHP's type juggling and the behavior of the `==` operator.

```php
$a = '0';
$b = 0;

if ($a == $b) {
  echo '$a and $b are equal';
} else {
  echo '$a and $b are not equal';
}

$a = '1';
$b = 1;

if ($a == $b) {
  echo '$a and $b are equal';
} else {
  echo '$a and $b are not equal';
}

$a = '1abc';
$b = 1;

if ($a == $b) {
  echo '$a and $b are equal';
} else {
  echo '$a and $b are not equal';
}
```

The output of the above script may be unexpected due to how PHP's loose comparison operator (`==`) works.  It does type coercion before comparison, leading to surprising results.  Specifically, '1abc' will still be compared to 1 which will lead to unexpected result.

The problem stems from PHP's loose comparison (`==`). It converts the string '1abc' to a number before the comparison, resulting in the numerical value 1. This leads to a comparison of 1 == 1, which evaluates to true.
